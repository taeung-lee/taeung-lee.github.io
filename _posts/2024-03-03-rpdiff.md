#### Title
Shelving, Stacking, Hanging: Relational Pose Diffusion for Multi-modal Rearrangement (CoRL, 2023)

#### Summary
Solving placement task in complex environment via diffusion-process.

#### Method
* Iteratively de-noise the 6-DoF pose of the object until it satisfies the desired geometric relationship with the scene point cloud.
* Train a neural network \(f_{\theta}\) to predict an SE(3) transformation from the combined object-scene point cloud at each time step \(t\).
* They also using separate clasifier \(h_{\phi}\) to avoid "local optimal" solutions by scoring the predicted poses among 0~1.
* They use transformer for processing point clouds and making pose predictions: 1) identify important geometric parts within the object and the scene, 2) capture relationships that occur between the important parts of the object and the scene.

#### Thoughts
* The paper's idea is intuitive. They consider (the position and the orientation) of target object and I think it is better than the other real-to-sim approaches.
* It seems like the paper of "6-dof graspnet" in the context of placement task because this paper consider the value of placement score among 0~1. 
* But the author says that the limitation is "demonstration" data can only be easily obtained via scripted policies in simulation. 
* And I think one more limitation is that they execute the predicted placement in open-loop. Adding the module about reacting or recovering from disturbance would be better.
