### 한 문장 요약

* Navigability를 정의하고, 이 latent spatial representation을 학습하자.

### Summary 
- Instead of learning to reconstruct, they cast the robotic perception task as a navigation task by a blind auxiliary agent generating a learning signal for the main agent.

### Contribution
- They propose learning a latent spatial representation (i.e., Navigability).
  - This approach differs from traditional methods that rely on explicit scene reconstruction. Instead, it relies on a learned latent spatial representation of the environment for navigation.
- They define representation $$r_t$$ and optimize it based on its amount of information. This representation is refined by a blind auxiliary agent, which operates without direct visual observations, thereby testing and refining its utility for navigation.
- The author describes the difference between the two methods based on **Behavior Cloning** and **Navigability**. 
  - **BC** directly learns the main target policy from expert trajectories, approximating the desired optimal policy. **Navigability**, on the other hand, focuses on learning a representation that optimizes navigational skills (i.e., actions) like detecting navigable space and avoiding obstacles, rather than reconstructing the scene in detail.

### Thought
- I thought that the proposed method seems like a teacher-student network. The main policy (teacher) provides a latent spatial representation (teaching material) that the blind auxiliary agent (student) uses to learn navigational actions. 
- The auxiliary agent's performance in navigating using this representation gives feedback to improve the main agent's ability to create effective latent representations. This method offers a more flexible and potentially robust way for robots to navigate diverse environments, especially where creating or relying on detailed maps is impractical or impossible.
- I think that It's a notable step forward in the development of autonomous systems that can adapt to a wide range of real-world conditions.
