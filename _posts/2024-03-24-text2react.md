#### Title:

Text2Reaction : Enabling Reactive Task Planning Using Large Language Models (R-AL, 2024)

#### Summary:

They propose Text2Reaction, an LLM-based framework enabling robots to continuously reason and update plans according to the latest environment changes.

#### Contribution:

* They present the Re-planning Prompt, which informs LLMs the basic principles of re-planning. 
  * It fosters the gradual development of a current plan to a new one in a three-hop reasoning manner: cause analysis, consequence inference, and plan adjustment
* OffPlanner: an LLM-based planner that generates initial plans
* On-Planner: another planner, which updates plans under the guidance of the re-planning prompts

#### Thoughts:

* Re-planning is an important part of the reactive robot. 
  * They showed an LLM-based framework capable of comprehensively analyzing various feedback and continuously re-planning in response to environment changes.
* They propose new evaluation metrics for the success rate of task replanning: Executability Rate(ER), Success weighted by Path Length(SPL).
