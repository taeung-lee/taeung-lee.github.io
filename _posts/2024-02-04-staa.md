### Summary

* They present ShortTerm Aborting A* (STAA*): operates in locally bounded map (seems like dwa algorithm) and avoiding dynamic obstacles using short-term aborting a* algorithm.
  * They find a global path via Minimal Construct algorithm. Due to the superior performance of the Minimal Construct algorithm, they can afford to recompute the global path in every control cycle; 4.34ms on average.
  * The STAA* motion planner operates in a bounded local map; (8m X 8m square), additionally, they define intermediate global goal pose within the local map.
  * Finally, they locally plan a collision-avoidance path using short-term aborting a*.

### Contributions

* Local map representation
* They propose local map representation by inflating convex polygons to avoid planning through too narrow passages the agent would not fit through.
  * Using [Minimal Construct](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8594124) algorithm
  * They set the local goal path as $\tilde{G}$ to plan in the local map.
* Short-Term Aborting A*: The centerpiece of this paper is specifically tailored for early abortion.
  * Like DWA, they sample actions in discrete ranges (in the paper they sample 7x7 actions) based on velocity specs: $(v_{\text{max}}, ~ w_{\text{max}})$
* Then they predict the successor state using their dynamic model of the robot.
  * The radius of the arc is obtained by only using $(v_{\text{max}}, ~ w_{\text{max}})$.
* They use SAT algorithm to check collisions.
  * [Separating Axis Theorem](https://doraeul19.tistory.com/253?category=1066045): Collision Detection Using the Separating Axis Theorem
* They evaluate heuristic functions leveraging RTR and PathRTR.
  * rotate-translate-rotate (RTR) time function: estimate the time needed to drive along a path to the intermediate goal and to attain the goal direction.

### Experiments

* Baselines
  * PD controller, DWA, STAA* (ours)
* Evaluation of different heuristic functions
  * Path RTR (ours)
  * Path Euclidean
  * Dijkstra
    * when all agents are using STAA* as a planner, almost all collisions can be avoided no matter which heuristic is being used.

### Thoughts

* The demo video shows powerful collision-free navigation and the visualization in the simulation is great. 
* I think the main contribution of this paper is tailored for early abortion. 
  * They also mentioned that one of the parameters is a trade-off between precision and computation time.
* And the second-most contribution is a novel time evaluation in goal navigation: Path RTR. They officially released the code, but the implementation is in C++. So I have to study the code and hope to reimplement this algorithm in the mujoco environment.
